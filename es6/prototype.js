/*
Wiki: Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as 
inheritance)  is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegation that serve as prototypes.
This model can also  be known as prototypal, prototype-oriented, classless, or instance-based programming. 
Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.
